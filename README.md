## Elevator Pitch
Super Smash Bros as a twin stick shooter. Different characters have different guns / abilities. Getting hit pushes you and increases damage rating. Higher damage ratings = more push. Try to knock each other off the stage.

## Goals
* immediately fun
* learn elixir (multiplayer) or learn monogame (local)
* simple to play, yet deep for masters (steal a lot of concepts from smash)

## Problems
* must be multiplayer (local or online)
* still need artist approval
* little will be useful for cursed castles
* will need lots of animation frames per character
* needs a minimum of 4 characters
* balance issues

## Art Style
* think enter the gungeon
* standard web game resolution (larger characters than I'm used to drawing)
* weird concept also allows for bright strange colors

## Elevator Pitch
Control two friends as they explore an open and expansive wilderness in a peaceful platforming metroidvania adventure. Swap between them and have them help each other reach new areas. Collect items/abilities as you go to make more of the map explorable.

## Goals
* animation heavy <- full of life even in inanimate objects (shaders)
* exploration > action
* learn tile maps
* lots directly applicable to cursed castle
* very little impact of death or mistake

## Problems
* content heavy (lots of art)
* design heavy (puzzles)
* gameplay light (not a lot beyond movement & abilities)

## Art Style
* think adventure time but pixels
* NESish resolution probably?
* lots of weird and bright colors (maybe pico8 palette)
